A single page system
`document.getElementsByClassName("pages");`

## How-to

Create files in the `pages` folder. Always make sure you have an `index.html` file.

All local links must be prefixed with `#!/`, and then contain a url relative to the `pages` folder. e.g. Link to `pages/test/index.html` as `<a href="#!/test/index.html">test</a>`.

## Note on SEO

This is theoretically capable of being SEO-friendly, but don't count on it. The `#!` at the start of the links can help, but won't do everything.
